sensorsAndroidClient
====================

Android client to get notifications from the sensors.

Requires google play services (which requires a not-incredibly-old version of android).  I'm targetting android-15 (my device is running 4.0.4).

In order to run, you'll need to add a resource file with a string key named "sender_id" -- see http://developer.android.com/google/gcm/gs.html.
